# scc403-data-mining
Final project for the SCC.403 data mining completed at Lancaster University in 2021. For this project we were given a collection of data  describing Mancehster's weather from 2010 to 2014. The aim of the project was to pre-process, cluster, and classify the data, and then classify new weather data. We then had to write a 6 page report detailing the various methods used.
